 After a paper published in 1979 by Wertheimer and Leeper have shown a positive association between extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (elf-mf) and infant leukemia, studies investigating the risks between the exposure to elf-mf and the development of diseases subsequently caused the classification of exposure to these fields as 2B (Possibly carcinogenic) by IARC. This study aims to analyze deaths by malignant neoplasia and the risks that occupational exposure to elf-mf may have as a co-carcinogenic or carcinogenic factor, in a hydroelectric power facility located in Brazil. A database of 1253 deceased workers from 1985 until 2011, where 249 were identified as exposed to electricity and 995 were not, was used to evaluate the MOR, which was calculated accordingly to the exposure to elf-mf for those who died from malignant neoplasia, a bootstrap method was used to lower the range of the confidence intervals and bring more reliable estimates to the chosen statistic, a database of those who died by cancer in the country was gathered from a Brazilian information system powered by INCA to compare the MOR by sex and age within the company and the country. When using the traditional method to calculate the MOR, an elevated MOR was found for esophagus cancer*(MOR=5,50; CI=1,06-28,33; P=0,0235)*, whereas in the bootstrap method the MOR was high for the following cancer types: Esophagus*(MORBoot=6,73; CI=1,74- 16,67; P<0,0001)*, Non Hodgkin Lymphoma*(MORBoot=6,03; CI=2,62-10,81; P<0,0001)*, Bladder*(MORBoot=6,03; CI=2,62-10,81; P<0,0001)* and Bone*(MORBoot=3,95; CI=2,62-5,26; P<0,0001)*. Some limitations of the study, such as the lack of information about the lifestyle of the workers and the small number of cases, make more difficult to consider exposure to elf-mf as a carcinogenic or co-carcinogenic factor, but despite the limitations in this study, the elevated MORs and BootMORs  should be taken seriously requiring further research and better-funded studies in the area.
