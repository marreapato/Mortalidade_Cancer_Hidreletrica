 After a paper published in 1979 by Wertheimer and Leeper have shown a positive association between extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (elf mf) and infant leukemia, studies investigating the risks between the exposure to elf mf and the development of diseases subsequently caused the classification of exposure to these fields as 2B (Possibly carcinogenic) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). This study aims to analyze deaths by malignant neoplasia and the risks that occupational exposure to elf mf may have as a co-carcinogenic or carcinogenic factor, in a hydroelectric power facility located in Brazil. A database of 1253 deceased workers in a time between 1985 and 2011, where 249 were identified as exposed to electricity and 995 were not, was used to evaluate the mortality odds ratio (MOR), which was calculated accordingly to the exposure to elf mf for those who died from malignant neoplasia, a bootstrap method was used to lower the range of the confidence intervals and bring more reliable estimates to the chosen statistic, a database of those who died by cancer in the country was gathered from a Brazilian information system powered by INCA (National Institute of Cancer) to compare the MOR by sex and age within the company and the country.
