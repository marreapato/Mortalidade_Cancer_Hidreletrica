abstract: >
 After a paper published in 1979 by Wertheimer and Leeper have shown a positive association between extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (elf mf) and infant leukemia, studies investigating the risks between the exposure to elf mf and the development of diseases subsequently caused the classification of exposure to these fields as 2B (Possibly carcinogenic) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). This study aims to analyze deaths by malignant neoplasia and occupational exposure to elf mf in a hydroelectric power facility located in Brazil and the risks that this kind of exposure may have as a co-carcinogenic or carcinogenic factor. A database of 1253 deceased workers who died in a time between 1985 and 2011 was gathered to evaluate the mortality odds ratio (MOR), which was calculated for those who were exposed to elf mf and died from malignant neoplasia in the company, a bootstrap method was used to lower the range of the confidence intervals, and a database of the Brazilian population who died from cancer was gathered from a Brazilian information system powered by INCA to compare the MOR by sex and age within the company and the country.
